We can work off of the blog data section of the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/blog-data\">Next.js tutorial</a> and add some additional YAML metadata to our markdown posts using <a href=\"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter\">gray-matter</a>.</p>\n<p>Within the current metadata, add a list of tags relevant to the post:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: 'Rebuilding my blog from scratch with Next.js'\ndate: '2022-04-23'\ntags: ['nextjs', 'react', 'javascript']\ndescription: 'Rebuilding my blog from a Gatsby.js templated site to a custom Next.js site from scratch.'\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>I won't cover rendering of the tags below each posts in the post list, but the tags list should get picked up automatically with the <code>getSortedPostsData()</code> function that was already written and is called by <code>getStaticProps()</code> in order to pass props down the the post related components.</p>\n<h3>/tags/[tag]</h3>\n<p>What we've done so far will associate posts with a list of tags, but now we also want a page for each tag that lists out the associated posts.  For example, to view <code>python</code> related posts, we can go to <a href=\"/tags/python\">/tags/python</a>.</p>\n<p>With Next.js, this can be done easily using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes\">dynamic routes</a>.</p>\n<p>Under the <code>pages/</code> directory, create a <code>pages/tags/[tag].js</code> file structure.  We'll be repeating similar patterns done within <code>pages/posts/[id].js</code>.</p>\n<p>Like earlier, we need to implement <code>getStaticProps()</code> (<a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props\">more info here</a>), so we can render these pages at build time.  We also need to implement <code>getStaticPaths()</code> (<a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths\">more info here</a>) to get a list of all possible tags at build time.</p>\n<p>Let's create a <code>lib/tags.js</code> file to house some of the helper functions to implement <code>getStaticProps()</code> and <code>getStaticPaths()</code>.</p>\n<p>First, we want to get a list of all the tags so we can write <code>getStaticPaths()</code>.  This will require processing all of the files within <code>posts/</code>, and processing the metadata using <a href=\"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter\">gray-matter</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>import fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport matter from 'gray-matter';\n\nconst postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');\n\nexport async function getAllTags() {\n  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);\n  const tags = new Set();\n\n  fileNames.map(fileName => {\n    // Read markdown file as string\n    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);\n    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');\n\n    // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section\n    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);\n    if (matterResult?.data?.tags) {\n      matterResult.data.tags.forEach(\n        (tag) => tags.add(`/tags/${tag.replace(/\\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase()}`)\n      );\n    }\n  });\n\n  return Array.from(tags);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can call this within <code>pages/tags/[tag].js</code> under <code>getStaticPaths()</code></p>\n<pre><code>export async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = await getAllTags();\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false,\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we can add another helper function <code>getPostDataByTag()</code> in <code>lib/tags.js</code> to fulfill <code>getStaticProps()</code>.  This is basically what we already do with <code>pages/posts/[id].js</code>, and it's not very efficient to do this twice, but all of this is happening at build time so it's not a huge deal for us.</p>\n<p>For this, we will use <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark\">remark</a> to process our markdown files.</p>\n<pre><code>import fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport matter from 'gray-matter';\nimport { remark } from 'remark';\nimport html from 'remark-html';\n\nconst postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');\n\nexport async function getPostDataByTag(tag) {\n  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);\n  const posts = [];\n\n  fileNames.map(async (fileName) => {\n    const id = fileName.replace(/\\.md$/, '');\n  \n    // Read markdown file as string\n    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);\n    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');\n\n    // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section\n    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);\n\n    if (matterResult?.data?.tags &#x26;&#x26; matterResult.data.tags.includes(tag)) {\n      // Use remark to convert markdown into HTML string\n      const processedContent = await remark()\n        .use(html)\n        .process(matterResult.content);\n      const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();\n\n      // Combine the data with the id and contentHtml\n      posts.push({\n        id,\n        contentHtml,\n        markdown: matterResult.content,\n        ...matterResult.data,\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  return posts;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can call this helper function in <code>pages/tags/[tag].js</code> under <code>getStaticProps()</code></p>\n<pre><code>export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { tag } = params;\n  const taggedPosts = await getPostDataByTag(tag);\n  return {\n    props: {\n      tag,\n      taggedPosts,\n    },\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, you can render the associated tag pages as you wish, but I did it with a few components I had set up:</p>\n<pre><code>export default function TagPage({ tag, taggedPosts }) {\n  const title = `Posts tagged \"${tag}\"`;\n  return (\n    &#x3C;Layout tagPage title={title} description={title}> \n      &#x3C;header>\n        &#x3C;Tag tag={tag} isHeader/>\n      &#x3C;/header>\n\n      &#x3C;section>\n        &#x3C;PostList posts={taggedPosts} />\n      &#x3C;/section>\n    &#x3C;/Layout>\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>All tags</h3>\n<p>The last thing we want to add is a page containing all of the tags in a list, and all of the posts organized into categories.</p>\n<p>To do this, we can add <code>pages/tags.js</code>, which can be reached at <a href=\"/tags\">/tags</a>.</p>\n<p>Once again, we want to implement <code>getStaticProps()</code> so we can pre-render this page at build time.  Luckily, we can reuse the two functions we wrote in <code>lib/tags.js</code> to make this easy.</p>\n<pre><code>import { getAllTags, getPostDataByTag } from '../lib/tags'\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const tagsWithPosts = {};\n  const allTags = await getAllTags();\n\n  for (const tagPath of allTags) {\n    const tag = tagPath.replace('/tags/', '');\n    tagsWithPosts[tag] = await getPostDataByTag(tag);\n  }\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      tagsWithPosts,\n    },\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, you can render this as you'd like using <code>tagsWithPosts</code> as a prop in your page component.  I also like having a toggle to show/hide the associated posts.</p>\n<pre><code>export default function TagPage({ tagsWithPosts }) {\n  const [showPosts, setShowPosts] = useState(false);\n\n  const tagAndPostList = Object.keys(tagsWithPosts).map((tag) => {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;section key={tag}>\n        &#x3C;Tag tag={tag} isHeader useLink label={tagsWithPosts[tag].length} />\n        {showPosts &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;PostList posts={tagsWithPosts[tag]} withPadding /> }\n      &#x3C;/section>\n    );\n  });\n\n  const title = 'All Tags';\n  return (\n    &#x3C;Layout title={title} description={title}>\n      &#x3C;header>\n        &#x3C;h1>All tags&#x3C;/h1>\n        &#x3C;div>\n          &#x3C;Checkbox label={'Show posts'} value={showPosts} onChange={(x) => setShowPosts(!showPosts)} />\n        &#x3C;/div>\n      &#x3C;/header>\n\n      {tagAndPostList}\n\n    &#x3C;/Layout>\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have a page with all of our tags üôå.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Adding a custom domain</h2>\n<p>Next on my todo list was adding a custom domain to transition from bschoeneweis.github.io ‚û°Ô∏è bradleyschoeneweis.com.

This will require processing all of the files within `posts/`, and processing the metadata using [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport matter from 'gray-matter';\n\nconst postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');\n\nexport async function getAllTags() {\n  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);\n  const tags = new Set();\n\n  fileNames.map(fileName => {\n    // Read markdown file as string\n    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);\n    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');\n\n    // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section\n    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);\n    if (matterResult?.data?.tags) {\n      matterResult.data.tags.forEach(\n        (tag) => tags.add(`/tags/${tag.replace(/\\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase()}`)\n      );\n    }\n  });\n\n  return Array.from(tags);\n}\n```\n\nNow we can call this within `pages/tags/[tag].js` under `getStaticPaths()`\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = await getAllTags();\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, we can add another helper function `getPostDataByTag()` in `lib/tags.js` to fulfill `getStaticProps()`.  This is basically what we already do with `pages/posts/[id].js`, and it's not very efficient to do this twice, but all of this is happening at build time so it's not a huge deal for us.\n\nFor this, we will use [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to process our markdown files.\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport matter from 'gray-matter';\nimport { remark } from 'remark';\nimport html from 'remark-html';\n\nconst postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');\n\nexport async function getPostDataByTag(tag) {\n  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);\n  const posts = [];\n\n  fileNames.map(async (fileName) => {\n    const id = fileName.replace(/\\.md$/, '');\n  \n    // Read markdown file as string\n    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);\n    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');\n\n    // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section\n    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);\n\n    if (matterResult?.data?.tags && matterResult.data.tags.includes(tag)) {\n      // Use remark to convert markdown into HTML string\n      const processedContent = await remark()\n        .use(html)\n        .process(matterResult.content);\n      const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();\n\n      // Combine the data with the id and contentHtml\n      posts.push({\n        id,\n        contentHtml,\n        markdown: matterResult.content,\n        ...matterResult.data,\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  return posts;\n}\n```\n\nWe can call this helper function in `pages/tags/[tag].js` under `getStaticProps()`\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const { tag } = params;\n  const taggedPosts = await getPostDataByTag(tag);\n  return {\n    props: {\n      tag,\n      taggedPosts,\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can render the associated tag pages as you wish, but I did it with a few components I had set up:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function TagPage({ tag, taggedPosts }) {\n  const title = `Posts tagged \"${tag}\"`;\n  return (\n    <Layout tagPage title={title} description={title}> \n      <header>\n        <Tag tag={tag} isHeader/>\n      </header>\n\n      <section>\n        <PostList posts={taggedPosts} />\n      </section>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### All tags\nThe last thing we want to add is a page containing all of the tags in a list, and all of the posts organized into categories.\n\nTo do this, we can add `pages/tags.js`, which can be reached at [/tags](/tags).\n\nOnce again, we want to implement `getStaticProps()` so we can pre-render this page at build time.  Luckily, we can reuse the two functions we wrote in `lib/tags.js` to make this easy.\n\n```js\nimport { getAllTags, getPostDataByTag } from '../lib/tags'\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const tagsWithPosts = {};\n  const allTags = await getAllTags();\n\n  for (const tagPath of allTags) {\n    const tag = tagPath.replace('/tags/', '');\n    tagsWithPosts[tag] = await getPostDataByTag(tag);\n  }\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      tagsWithPosts,\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can render this as you'd like using `tagsWithPosts` as a prop in your page component.  I also like having a toggle to show/hide the associated posts.\n\n```jsx\nexport default function TagPage({ tagsWithPosts }) {\n  const [showPosts, setShowPosts] = useState(false);\n\n  const tagAndPostList = Object.keys(tagsWithPosts).map((tag) => {\n    return (\n      <section key={tag}>\n        <Tag tag={tag} isHeader useLink label={tagsWithPosts[tag].length} />\n        {showPosts && <PostList posts={tagsWithPosts[tag]} withPadding /> }\n      </section>\n    );\n  });\n\n  const title = 'All Tags';\n  return (\n    <Layout title={title} description={title}>\n      <header>\n        <h1>All tags</h1>\n        <div>\n          <Checkbox label={'Show posts'} value={showPosts} onChange={(x) => setShowPosts(!showPosts)} />\n        </div>\n      </header>\n\n      {tagAndPostList}\n\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow we have a page with all of our tags üôå.\n\n---\n\n## Adding a custom domain\nNext on my todo list was adding a custom domain to transition from bschoeneweis.github.io ‚û°Ô∏è bradleyschoeneweis.com.  GitHub gives a good overview of the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain), but we'll go through it below specifically using [Google domains](https://domains.google/).\n\nWe'll be using an apex domain (e.g. bradleyschoeneweis.com).\n\n### GitHub changes\n1. Go to the repository settings for your GitHub pages repository\n2. Click into the **Pages** section\n3. Type your apex domain into the **Custom domain** input and click **Save**\n\n### Google domains changes\n1. Go to your [Google domains registrar](https://domains.google.com/registrar/)\n2. Click **Manage** on the domain you'd like to use\n3. Navigate to the **DNS** settings and under **Resource records**, click **Manage custom records**\n4. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain) for the official IP address list, but add the following `A` and `CNAME` records\n\n![DNS records](/images/rebuilding-my-blog/dns-records.jpg)\n\n### Final steps and confirmation\n1. Head back to the **Pages** settings for your repository and check **Enforce HTTPS**\n2. After a bit of time has passed, run `dig www.mynewdomain.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd` replace with your domain name and your output should look similar to the following:\n\n![dig output](/images/rebuilding-my-blog/dig-output.jpg)\n\nNow your custom domain should be all set up with your GitHub pages blog! üéâ\n\n---\n\n## Simple automated deployment\nFor the final touches, I didn't want to have to worry about building the blog locally each time, so we'll create a simple GitHub action to build and serve our blog on each commit.\n\n### The `package.json` scripts\nIf you don't have one already, you should create a `build` script in `package.json` as `build: \"next build\"`.\n\nI won't cover it here, but you'll also need to go through tutorials related to [exporting your Next.js project as static HTML](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).  There are a few gotchas here.  For example, you cannot use the Next.js image optimization or API routes.  You can see the full list of [unsupported features](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export#unsupported-features).\n\nLong story short, within your `package.json` file, you should add an `export: \"next export\"` script.  This will create an `out/` directory with HTML files when this command is run.  You probably want to add this directory to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n### Deploy key\nWe will be using [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) for making the deployment step easy.  As a part of this, we want to set up an SSH deploy key for safety.\n\nYou can use an SSH key that you already have setup, or create a new one with:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"$(git config user.email)\" -f gh-pages -N \"\"\n```\n\n1. Navigate back to your repository settings, and under security, go to **Deploy keys**\n2. Click **Add a deploy key** and enter `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY` as the title\n3. Paste in your public RSA key (ends with `.pub`)\n4. Check **Allow write access** and then click **Add key**\n\n### `deploy.yml`\nNow that every thing is set up, we can put this all into a GitHub actions file.\n\nFrom the root of the project, create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and refer to the following:\n\n```yml\nname: Deploy to Github Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - develop\n\njobs:\n  deployment:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node-version: [14.x]\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n\n      - name: Update NPM\n        run: npm i -g npm@latest\n\n      - name: Cache dependencies\n        uses: actions/cache@v2\n        with:\n          path: ~/.npm\n          key: ${{ runner.OS }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            ${{ runner.OS }}-node-\n            ${{ runner.OS }}-\n\n      - name: Build\n        run: |\n          npm i --legacy-peer-deps\n          npm run build\n          npm run export\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}\n          publish_dir: ./out\n          cname: yoururl.com\n```\n\nA few things to note:\n- The branch I actively work on is `develop`, so you'll want to update that to the branch you push to\n- If you didn't name your deploy key `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`, change the `deploy_key` value to `secrets.[Your key name]` in the **Deploy** step\n- The `cname` value in the **Deploy** step should be replaced with your newly configured custom domain\n\nNow, each time you commit and push up you blog changes, your blog should automatically be built and served under your custom domain.\n\nJust like that, your blog is just as functional as a cookiecutter template üç™ and more easy to build upon than ever before.\n\n---\n","title":"Rebuilding my blog from scratch with Next.js","date":"2022-04-23","tags":["nextjs","react","javascript"],"description":"Rebuilding my blog from a Gatsby.js templated site to a custom Next.js site from scratch."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
