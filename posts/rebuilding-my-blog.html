<p>The first iteration of my blog was built using a pre-configured <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">GatsbyJS</a> site template.  I chose a template (<a href="https://novela.narative.co/" target="_blank">Novela by Narative</a>) that checked all my boxes for an easy tool to start sharing my writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The theme was modern and sleek</li>
<li>Everything was mobile-friendly</li>
<li>Lots of plug-and-play options and prebuilt components that flowed together well
<ul>
<li>Article metadata that connected to an author bio page</li>
<li>Reading time estimates and progress bars</li>
<li>Easy image optimizations</li>
<li>A config for a Google Analytics tag</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deployment was straightforward with GitHub pages</li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, all I had to do was add Markdown pages to a directory to get started.  At the time, I didn&#x27;t really know much about GatsbyJS, other than it being a popular static site generator, and my modern JavaScript knowledge was introductory at-best (albeit growing each and everyday).  So this seemed like the perfect route forward.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>As I began writing more and more posts, I began noting different features I wanted to include on my site.  These weren&#x27;t terribly complex additions, but rather simple things like adding tags to group common posts or wanting to change the styling of the inline code snippets.</p>
<p><strong>I soon discovered that trying to color outside the lines when using a cookiecutter template can make things very complex, very quickly.</strong></p>
<p>I found myself digging into nested modules in my <code style="font-family:Fira Code;border:none;font-variant-ligatures:none;background-color:rgb(246, 249, 252);padding:3px;border-radius:3px">node_modules</code> folder where I would need to overload different functions and components to get what I wanted.  It was added complexity than I didn&#x27;t foresee when I signed up to use a template.  Plus, this site could eventually house more than just a blog, and the template I chose wasn&#x27;t designed to accommodate much else.</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>If you haven&#x27;t noticed from the timestamp on my last article, I haven&#x27;t written a post in ~5 months.  This is largely because I was interviewing for new positions and eventually joined the team at <a href="https://radar.com" target="_blank">Radar</a> as a Product Engineer!  Preparation for interviews and taking a break after accepting this new position occupied much of the time I would normally spend writing.</p>
<p>The reason I mention this is because one of the technologies we use at Radar is <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>.  Next.js was something I was already trying to learn in my free time, but I&#x27;ve been able to gain a good amount of experience with it since I&#x27;ve started my new role, and my modern JavaScript fundamentals and understanding have grown drastically in the past several month (expect a lot more JavaScript posts going forward).</p>
<p>Seeing the power of Next.js and knowing I wanted my blog to be more flexible, I decided to recreate my blog from scratch using Next.js!</p>

<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p>A quick prelude on <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a> for those who have never used it.  <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a>, the creators of Next.js (and a company to keep üëÄ on) says it best, Next.js is...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> Framework for Production&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next.js comes with a ton of great built-in features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static + server-side rendering</li>
<li>Smart bundling and code-splitting, TypeScript support, Routing, Fast Refresh, CSS + Sass support all without complex configs</li>
<li>Image optimization</li>
<li>Intuitive code organization (because there are a million-plus ways to organize a React project)</li>
<li>Static HTML exports (this one is important for our purposes)</li>
<li>So much more...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It really is an awesome framework.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app" target="_blank">Next.js hands-on tutorial</a> coincidentally enough is setting up a blog with Next.js, so following this tutorial will set you up with a great and simplistic starter blog (but not quite ready for deployment unless using Vercel).</p>
<p>A few things this tutorial covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the Next.js app</li>
<li>Basics like in-app navigation, styling, adding images and more</li>
<li>Setting up metadata, blog pages, and pre-rendering</li>
<li>Markdown -&gt; HTML</li>
<li>Reworking your app to use dynamic routing</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial is great so I won&#x27;t cover anything that&#x27;s already covered there.  If you&#x27;re interested in using Next.js, you should definitely go through it.</p>
